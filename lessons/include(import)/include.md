    // include() - copies the content of a file (php, html, text) and includes 
    // it in your php file. secitions of your website become reusable
    // changes only need to be made in one place.

    // this is basically importing other files

    // the files to be worked with are about.php, locations.php, index.php
    // header.html and footer.html

    // to use header.html in index.php (put this in index.php)
    <?php
    include("header.html");
    ?>
